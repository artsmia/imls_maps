The foliate rim is decorated in a stylized wave pattern ultimately based on a Chinese prototype. Because Ottoman sultans amassed large collections of Chinese ceramics, imported wares naturally influenced local production. The potters of Iznik, however, soon created an original decorative vocabulary. The tulips, pinks, irises, and cypress comprising the center of this dish, for instance, are not found in this combination on Chinese wares.",

    "text": "This standing figure is a bodhisattva, a being who has postponed its own passage to nirvana in order to guide others to salvation. Bodhisattvas are often depicted as paired attendants to a buddha. This sculpture, too, was probably once worshipped as part of a triad of sculptures, positioned to either the left or right of a central icon. This bodhisattva stands on a stone base (the square plinth, two lions, and the lower half of a lotus-shaped pedestal) that was created for a separate sculpture of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Several lengthy inscriptions on the base explain that an original sculpture was created in 570, and then another was installed at the same temple in 581, both utilizing this base. In 574, an emperor of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–81) prohibited Buddhism in China, and many idols were desecrated. This may be the reason the base has some apparently intentional damage (two of four lions have been removed) and is no longer with its original sculpture. At some later date, the base came to be used for the present bodhisattva. In the early 1900s, it became the first work of Asian art to enter Mia’s collection.",

Several years later he attained enlightenment and devoted his life to teaching people throughout northern India about a means of escaping from forms of suffering. This was the beginning of what we now know as Buddhism. This sculpture highlights the Buddha as a teacher of the people, walking peacefully with his eyes lowered. It is a distinctly human presentation of Shakyamuni, in contrast to more iconic forms. This sculptural type, closely associated with the Sukhothai Kingdom of Thailand, flourished in the 1300s and 1400s.",

Rarely, however, do you hear about them.\n\nThat’s likely to change as the taboo surrounding suicide attempts gets a new look. Survivors who have banded together via social media say their stories can play an important role in keeping others from the abyss; they are demanding to be heard despite worry that their stories may inspire others to act. The nation’s oldest suicide prevention organization recently voted to recognize this once invisible portion of its membership: the roughly 1 million Americans who try to end their lives each year, outnumbering the 38,000 who succeed.   —Diane Richard, writer, April 16\n\nImage: Michael Appleton for the New York Times\n\nSource: Benedict Carey, “Suicide Prevention Sheds a Longstanding Taboo: Talking About Attempts,”New York Times,April 14\n\n\n",

Recent research on sexual violence in American society suggests that our understanding of these crimes—about both the victims and perpetrators—needs updating: about a third of rape victims are male, and a sizable number of rapes are committed by women.  \n\nWhat accounts for this? Among other things, law enforcement groups are broadening the definition of “rape” to cover more forms of sexual aggression. Also, previous statistics on rape have not included populations living behind bars, for which the incidence of male victimization—often at the hands of women—is astonishingly high.    —Alex Bortolot, Content Strategist, May 1\n\n**\n\nImage: Photo by Thomas Northcut/Thinkstock\n\nSource: Hanna Rosin, “When Men Are Raped: A new study reveals that men are often the victims of sexual assault, and women are often the perpetrators,” Slate, 4/29/14\n\n\n",

        "description": "During the Gilded Age, Americans developed an appetite for paintings by 17th-century Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn. His paintings are now found in public and private collections from coast to coast. This exhibition will bring together one of the most substantial groups of Rembrandt paintings assembled in America in a generation. While the main focus of the show will be on the artist and his remarkable development as a painter, attention will also be given to his influence on other artists, his status as an icon, and America’s relationship to his art. Taken as a whole, the Rembrandts in America have a distinctive character: the overwhelming majority are in portrait format whether they are portraits or not. The MIA’s own Lucretia, a single-figure half-length, is a prime example.\r\nThe paintings will be a placed in groups that attempt to illuminate specific issues, such as Rembrandt’s experimentation with different ways of handling paint, his interest in actual portraiture and in various types of fantasy portraiture, and the issue of defining the boundaries of his art. While this exhibition cannot be viewed as a full-scale retrospective, it will provide visitors the rare opportunity to observe Rembrandt’s evolution from brash young artist, to confident master, to resolute observer of timeless humanity. Rembrandt collecting has always been a challenging field. The works can be difficult and expensive to obtain, and questions of authenticity are ever present. American collectors—and they are not alone in this—have often bought paintings thinking that they were getting Rembrandts only to find out later that they were the product of other hands. For this reason, a number of works formerly attributed to Rembrandt will be displayed, including one or two for which the pendulum of scholarly opinion has swung back and forth. We hope to use this opportunity to suggest answers to the all too obvious but usually evaded question: If Rembrandt is such a genius, why is it so difficult to tell which paintings are his?\r\nThe exhibit",

These two paintings, Saint Sirus and Saint Paul, were likely part of a larger altarpiece made up of many panels, called a polyptych. The presence of a saint on an altarpiece could have a number of meanings. The saint could be the patron saint of the church or city that housed the altarpiece, for example. The key to identifying saints is to look closely at the attributes shown with them. Saint Sirus wears a mitre, the pointed headpiece, and holds a crozier, or ceremonial staff. These attributes indicate Saint Sirus was a bishop. Saint Paul is shown with his usual physical characteristics-receding hairline and long, brown beard; he is also holding a sword, his personal attribute.",

Through the open window can be seen the figure of Saint Jerome, the 4th-century biblical scholar, often portrayed in medieval art as a kneeling hermit. He is identified by a broad-brimmed cardinal's hat and the lion that was his legendary companion. During the Renaissance, however, Saint Jerome was frequently shown as a cultured man of learning in his study—a representation this sitter clearly wished his portrait to suggest. The identities of both artist and sitter have long been debated. The most persuasive evidence indicates that Lorenzo Costa painted a high-ranking prelate, possibly Cardinal Bibbiena, while court painter in Mantua, a sophisticated center of humanist culture.",

Today one of the most widely practiced of the Buddhist faiths in the countries of East Asia, Pure Land Buddhism emerged in India and spread to China in the 100s CE and Japan by the early 800s. This sculpture would have originally served as the principal object of worship at a Japanese Pure Land temple, and would have been flanked by sculptures of his attendant bodhisattvas: Avalokiteshvara (J: Kannon) and Mahāsthāmaprāpta (J: Seishi). This sculptor used the yosegi-zukuri technique, whereby parts of a sculpture are roughly carved from multiple blocks of wood. Those blocks are pieced together to form a complete sculpture that is then carved in more detail, hollowed out, and often covered in gold foil, as was the case with this Amitābha.",

Starting next year, Chinese pilots will have to pass a language test and rid themselves of heavy accents. Which might help avoid situations like the one a few years ago when a Chinese pilot asked to “taxi” by a Japanese air traffic controller instead heard “take off.” Which he did. \n\n  —Tim Gihring, editor\n\nSeptember 4, 2014\n\nSource: Asia.nikkei.com, August 30, 2014\n\n\n",

Two sons followed their father into his profession of goldsmith and jeweler. The portraits of Catharina and Lucas remained in the van Voorst family until 1968. Sometime during those 340 years, the oak panels were reduced in height by about eight inches—mostly at the bottom. Originally, this painting showed all of Catharina’s white feather fan.

        "description": "The Sacred Symbols exhibition provided a unique opportunity to see the arts created by the people of the ancient Americas in all their beauty, variety and complexity. It featured works from a selection of the notable civilizations found throughout North, Central and South America, objects ranging in time of creation from 2500 BC to the initial period of contact with Europeans in the 16th century. These pieces represented a great variety of artistic styles powerfully expressing the fundamental religious, historical and political aspects of the lives of the people who created them. \r\nAll of the approximately 180 objects in the exhibition were selected from the collections of American museums in the FRAME (French Regional American Museums Exchange) consortium and are masterpieces reflecting the strongest works available throughout the United States. Highlights of the show included elegant ceramics decorated with abstract and representational art designs from the Southwestern region of the present United States, as well as refined stone sculptures, ceramics and personal ornaments from the Southeast. Ancient Mexican cultures were represented by the superbly carved jade statues of figures and animals of the Olmec, the expertly painted ceramic vessels illustrating themes from mythology and history, and elaborately carved stone figures created by artists of the Maya civilization, and the inventive ceramic sculptures from the people of the Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco regions representing different aspects of everyday life. From Central America there were magnificent golden ornaments fashioned in the form of human beings, mythological figures and animals, which were used by chiefs and other people of high status to adorn themselves and mark their status. There were also beautifully modeled and painted ceramics from Ancient Peru, representing individuals, animals and objects from the ceremonial and political culture of the Moche and Nazca people, plus some highly ornamented Incan vessels that showed the interaction of Nat",

This sculpture is from Gandhara, a historical region in present-day northwest Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. Gandharan art has close affinities with ancient Greek and Roman art, evidenced by the flowing folds of robes and chiseled facial features. Greek troops occupied the area in 330 BCE, and Indian, Persian, and central Asian forces also established a presence there between 300 BCE and 460 CE. Trade provided the ultimate incentive for all travelers, as Gandhara occupied a central location along the caravan routes that connected China to lands farther west.",

    "text": "The architectural elements of the Charleston Drawing and Dining Rooms are from a commodious townhouse built in 1772 in Charleston, South Carolina, for Colonel John Stuart, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the British government. Like most fashionable houses erected in Charleston in the 18th century, the Stuart house was one room wide and flanked by a balcony - a spatial arrangement that allowed cooling ocean breezes to flow through the interior. This room was originally on the second floor and remains virtually intact. The closed door at the far end of the room initially led to the balcony, and there were windows where two passageways now connect this room with the Charleston Dining Room. This room, the largest in the house, was probably used for dinner parties, dances, and other entertainments. It was originally equipped with costly new furniture made in Charleston and other seaports along the East Coast, such as Boston, Newport, and Philadelphia. The furniture was in the rococo or Chippendale style, named for the English cabinetmaker and designer Thomas Chippendale, and is noted for its sinuous lines and beautifully carved organic ornament. The outstanding quality of the rococo carving over the fireplace and the precise classical proportions of the woodwork were probably executed by the English-trained craftsman Ezra Waite, who was responsible for numerous other pre-revolutionary Charleston interiors. The present arrangement of the room is similar to that of its 1931 installation, when the great silver collectors, James Ford Bell and his wife, Louise Heffelfinger, presented it to the museum. The furniture and decoration of the room reflect the 18th-century taste for fine objects made along the East Coast and England as well as items imported from China. In the 18th century, seating furniture lined the walls when not in use and the floors were left bare.",

Though it may depend on context. The Charleston Drawing Room, for instance, came from the home of Colonel John Stuart, an 18th-century British sympathizer who owned 200 slaves.

    "text": "This architecturally important room was the informal parlor of a house built in about 1772 in Providence, Rhode Island. Other rooms from the house are owned by the Brooklyn Museum and the Denver Art Museum. The house, while modified, still stands on North Main Street (then King Street). The classically inspired front doorway of the house includes an impressive arched pediment above Corinthian pilasters. The design of the doorway and the paneled interior of the parlor, with dentil molding and elaborate triangular pediment, were taken from popular 18th-century pattern books, including Batty Langley's widely circulated The Builder's Compleat Assistant (London, 1738). The original owner of the house was Joseph Russell, a prosperous merchant in the West Indies trade who sold exotic goods. Russell's daughter, Susan Conde Russell, married John Corlis in 1790, and shortly thereafter acquired her father's home. Installed in 1923, the Providence Parlor was the first American period room in the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and was originally furnished by the Friends of the Institute. Through later restorations to its original paint color and proportions, the Providence Parlor provides a rare glimpse into the life of the Russell-Corlis family in late-18th-century New England.",

In a remarkable testimony to the power of gender bias, researchers recently found that hurricanes given female names are deadlier than those with male names, even when they’re the same strength—apparently because feminine-sounding storms are perceived as less dangerous.\n\nStudy participants told that a Hurricane Danny was approaching were more likely to evacuate than those told that a Hurricane Kate was imminent. Hurricanes weren’t named at all when one of the worst in New England history struck Providence in 1815—they weren’t even called hurricanes. It was called the Great September Gale (not Gail).\n\n—Tim Gihring\n\nJune 4, 2014\n\nSource: Los Angeles Times, June 2, 2014\n\n\n",

The accompanying portrait of her husband, Doge Marino Grimani, is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. From a prominent and wealthy patrician family, Morosini was a patron of the city’s lace industry. She is depicted in a stylish burgundy velvet dress with ruffled lace sleeves and translucent tulle over the shoulders. Notice how the landscape in the window behind the Dogaressa is continued in the background window of the Doge’s portrait. The swaths of silk also link the portraits, acting as bookends that enclose the couple. Whereas Grimani’s portrait was painted by Tintoretto himself, Morosini’s was executed by Tintoretto’s assistants. The pair of paintings date from before Grimani’s election as doge in 1595.",

Who wouldn’t want this exotic scene of wealth and beauty decorating their home, literally surrounding the family as though they themselves were in the garden, toasting their good fortune?</p><p>The wallpaper was hand-painted in China in the late 1700s or early 1800s, and exported for display in rooms like this one represents, a parlor in the home of a wealthy New England merchant. The wallpaper was donated to Mia by Mabel and Wayne H. MacFarlane, and usually recedes into the background, behind furniture also given by the MacFarlane family and set up in this room in the 1970s. The furniture has been removed to highlight the story playing out on the walls.</p><p> </p>",

It features an exuberant five-claw imperial dragon as the central motif, which projects an air of majesty and power as it strides around the surface of the vessel. Four frontal lion masks, alternating with stylized clouds, decorate the shoulder. The scale and imperial imagery of this magnificent vase suggest a formal use within the halls of an imperial compound. It was likely one of a matching pair of vases, used to create balanced, formal arrangements in the large rooms of the Forbidden City, the imperial palace in Beijing.",

    "text": "Chinese government envoys sent to central Asia returned to court marveling over a breed of “heavenly horse” like no other, a stout animal with powerful back and shoulders that worked so hard it sweated blood. The Chinese emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) became obsessed with these stories and dispatched diplomats and later a military force to obtain the horses. His interest in these remarkable horses and the growing role horses played in military campaigns largely account for the popularity of the horse in art from the Han dynasty, in particular the era in which Wu ruled. Bronze horses such as this one were placed in elaborately furnished aristocratic tombs and were meant to provide transportation for the deceased in the afterlife. This spirited horse, a blend of ideal and real in its modeling, captures the spirit of the fabled “celestial horses” of the Han dynasty.",

    "text": "While the earliest Chinese blue-and-white ware was made for the fourteenth century Persian market, this classic dish exemplifies the transition in early Ming towards the true recognition and wide appreciation of blue-and-white porcelain by the Chinese court and scholar class. The aesthetic preference in early fifteenth century ceramics was for a pure white, fine porcelain body acting as a bright ground to brilliant cobalt blue designs protected under a hard, clear glaze. The painted designs were continuous around the form; wave patterns on the rim, with twining flowers around the cavetto, the exterior, and in the center creating a beautifully elegant, unified composition. The high level of craftsmanship here contrasts dramatically with the dish shown to the right which was made specifically for export to foreign markets. The shape is uneven, the ground a greyish-white, the blue designs pale and sketchy. The design also lacks the continuity of the imperial example with eight panels evenly placed around the cavetto crating a static effect. These panels were, however, very popular motifs in blue-and-white intended for the European markets. The Chinese dominated world trade in porcelain for nearly 800 years.",

Camels were treasured for their reliability in transporting people and trade merchandise through the great Gobi and Tarim deserts. Most camel herders were foreigners from Mongolia and central Asia. The great dusty beasts thronging the sprawling markets of cities like Chang’an (present-day Xi’an) and Luoyang gave Tang potters ample opportunity to study their every characteristic as well as those of the foreigners who tended them.",

Today, they’ve identified yet another foreign mode of transport for long stints on the road: the American-style RV. \n\nThe RV biz is booming as Chinese take to the highways for a little R&amp;R. Companies also use them to do business in cities glutted with gridlock.

    "text": "This one-of-a-kind shirt was created in the 18th century by Native Americans living in the Great Lakes or Woodlands region. Early French explorers interacted and traded with Native American tribes in the area referred to as New France, a French colony that existed from 1534-1763. This area initially extended from the state of New York to Minnesota, and from Canada to Louisiana. News of interesting \"primitive\" Native American people was sent to French royalty who demanded items created by these people be brought back home. This garment would have been worn by a Native American man of high status, and was created and painted by a woman. The animal hide is probably antelope, traded from the tribes to the west because it is stronger and thinner than deer hide. The shirt has elements from Woodlands, Great Lakes, and Plains regions, and the complex designs may have been inspired by tattooing. Shown headless and with pointed body and wings, the interlocking abstracted painted designs on the body probably represents the sacred Thunderbird, an important being in traditional Native American spirituality. The extreme degree of stylization clearly demonstrates that artistic abstraction was practiced by Native artists at the time. With less than 35 surviving objects from the early 1700s decorated with abstract painting of these regions, this is the only known surviving example of a painted shirt.",

Drawing on his experience as both fiber artist and dancer, each suit is meticulously handcrafted with attention to both design and function. While the Soundsuits work as freestanding sculptures, Cave originally made them to be worn. He has staged numerous events in which the Soundsuits become moveable collages of material and history, each \"enacted\" by a performer who takes on its unique character. Cave’s first Soundsuitwas created the early 1990s in response to the racial profiling and beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles by police officers, and the subsequent riots. The Soundsuits have often been described as a protective “second skin.” Cave’s creations allow the wearer to subsume their own identity and to adopt that of the sculpture/garment in a fusion of textile art, sculpture, and performance.",

They might even wear micro-minis, satin overalls, and glittery platform shoes to give their tax return a lift.\n\nThat’s true in the case of ABBA, Sweden’s top pop export. According to a new book, the Swedish tax code deemed the band’s fashion tastes sufficiently “outrageous” to qualify for tax deductions. Reflecting on the group’s satin-and-sparkles style, band member Björn Ulvaeus, shown below at left, said: “In my honest opinion we looked like nuts in those years.

        "description": "This first-look exhibition of over 100 highlights from the Clark Collections, recently acquired by the MIA, offers unusually rich and personal insights into the scope of Japanese art and the nature of connoisseurship. Bill and Libby Clark amassed one of the world’s finest collections of Japanese art according to their own finely honed interests, instincts, and idiosyncrasies. Not trends. Not markets. Not a particular time, place, or medium. They collected what they liked—what drew their audacious eyes.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition hints at the stunning variety and bold taste that accorded the Clarks’ endeavor, begun in the late 1970s, a kind of legendary status. Tucked in the agricultural valley of central California, their collection grew from frequent trips to Japan, stoking their enthusiasm for Japanese aesthetics—their home is a blend of Japanese and California Arts and Crafts styles. The combined collection of the Clarks and the Clark Center for Japanese Art & Culture reached almost 1,700 objects, ranging across 10 centuries and from paintings to sculpture, ceramics to textiles, woodblock prints to works of bamboo. They include important examples from every school of painting in Japan since the 16th century and from some of its most acclaimed living artists, including 80 pieces by ceramist Fukami Sueharu—the largest assembly of his sleek bluish-white porcelain in the world.",

    "text": "European merchants and missionaries in Japan discovered the beauty of lacquer in 1543 and began commissioning artists to create furnishings for European homes and churches soon thereafter. By 1610, an import company was established in Amsterdam to meet demand. This portable desk has a drop front and small drawers inside for storing writing supplies, making it a bargueño, a style of desk that emerged in Spain during the Renaissance. Its surfaces are richly decorated with traditional Japanese motifs executed in lacquer and inlaid metals and mother-of-pearl. Cartouches on the front and top show deer and a small hut in a grove of trees. Morning glories decorate the rear panel and the inside of the drop front, while the interior drawers feature auspicious motifs also commonly seen in Japanese paintings and textiles: fish among waterweeds, geese and reeds, birds among blossoming trees, and wheels partially submerged in a flowing stream.",

The MIA will highlight the breadth of this gift by presenting an exhibition that features more than 170 masterpieces of Japanese and Korean art, ranging from prehistoric to the late 19th century. Among the objects are stunning ink paintings like Kichizan Mincho's (1352–1431) interpretation of the bodhisattva Monju by the artist, a 16th-century water jar (mizusashi) known as \"Burst Bag\" from the kilns in Iga for use in tea ceremony, a pair of folding screens of hollyhocks and plum trees by the artist Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), a pair of screens of Chinese children playing \"crack the whip\" and examining an elephant by the eccentric artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), and a luminous 12th-century celadon Korean maebyong vessel inlaid with a pattern ofa crane amid clouds.

    "text": "John Wilson’s portrait of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is based on his 1986 memorial statue of the civil rights leader housed in the United States Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. As in the sculpture, Wilson captures King’s physical attributes and inner spirit in equal measure, presenting a countenance of solemn contemplation while suggesting a certain vulnerability. Rendered nearly life-size, King appears almost weary, as if struggling with the psychological and spiritual burdens of his prominent role in the fight for equal rights. At the same time, the portrait’s scale and formal structure lend the work an underlying sense of strength and solidity. Wilson also alludes to King’s death as a sacrifice. Though not overt, the crossing of the horizon line and the vertical line formed by King’s suit jacket signifies the wooden cross of Christ’s crucifixion. Like Jesus, King gave his life for a higher moral cause. Together, these salient features present King, who was one of the most esteemed public figures of the twentieth century, as both a man and a national hero.",

The print’s limited palette and simplified formal arrangement typify Hammick’s minimalist approach, one in which the dreamlike landscape serves as the setting for a metaphorical consideration of the human condition. The lone figure is a symbolic stand-in for human experience. We observe from a distance while the man peers at the night landscape, as if in silent dialogue with his surroundings. Like a poem or a piece of music, Hammick’s abstracted landscape possesses a deep emotional resonance that is at once familiar and mysterious",

    "accessionHighlightText": "As museums increasingly display and add to their collections to reflect the complex and fascinating global phenomena that preceded our own time, objects like this bufetillo, or writing box, are key. This beautiful example provides a Colonial American narrative and a backstory that directly relates to the history of Mexican Americans. In this way, it supports the community-facing initiatives that anchor Mia’s 2016-2020 Strategic Plan. The box demonstrates how indigenous peoples of Michoacán, Mexico, adapted a regional decorative technique to European forms. The Purépecha people had developed a type of inlaid lacquer work applied to decorated gourd vessels in the pre-colonial period. Upon the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the technique was combined with European-style wood furniture forms such as this bufetillo. These boxes and other objects were portable and affordable, while still considered luxurious—perfect for Spanish colonists and even for export to Europe and other parts of the Spanish colonial empire. Most remarkably, the box is decorated on every side and teems with activity, from benign to dangerous, depicted in an animated way through stylization that appears more indigenous than Western. ",

He shows his Charity group the tenderness of a parent, and Charity gives to him the rewards of his creativity.

He apparently got hold of nearly all of the rare gampi paper that reached Holland in the 1640s.",

Andrus III had a particular passion for these small-scale marvels, and now selected works from his exceptional collection are being unveiled in Gallery 344. They are part of a generous gift of more than 230 works from John and Marion Andrus’s three daughters, Elizabeth, Julie, and Catherine. \r\nThis display focuses on prints from the 16th and 17th centuries. Most are no bigger than a credit card. Some, like Rembrandt’s Goldsmith, have an intimate, personal feel. Other prints began life as ornamental designs for sheaths or brooches. A series of tiny religious scenes by Jacques Callot were meant to be used as paper substitutes for pilgrim badges. The German Kleinmeister, or Little Masters—followers of Albrecht Dürer—executed diminutive gems with uncommon charm, playfulness, and technical refinement, as exemplified by this Italianate nude. Come enter this world of tiny treasures, and little by little they will take your breath away.",

        "description": "In March 2015 it was announced that the Japanese art collection of St. Paul native Mary Griggs Burke, long considered the finest private collection of its kind outside of Japan, is bequeathed to the MIA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The MIA will highlight the breadth of this gift by presenting an exhibition that features more than 170 masterpieces of Japanese and Korean art, ranging from prehistoric to the late 19th century. Among the objects are stunning ink paintings like Kichizan Mincho's (1352–1431) interpretation of the bodhisattva Monju by the artist, a 16th-century water jar (mizusashi) known as \"Burst Bag\" from the kilns in Iga for use in tea ceremony, a pair of folding screens of hollyhocks and plum trees by the artist Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), a pair of screens of Chinese children playing \"crack the whip\" and examining an elephant by the eccentric artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), and a luminous 12th-century celadon Korean maebyong vessel inlaid with a pattern ofa crane amid clouds.

In time, artists created decorative objects inspired by Chinese forms and motifs. This tapestry, one of a six-part series designed by the French painter François Boucher, captures the bustle of a European marketplace thinly disguised as a Chinese fair. Pagoda roofs, rickshaws, and Asian costumes, along with elephants and camels, help complete this illusion. In the 18th century, it was fashionable to install tapestries permanently on the walls and to decorate the rooms accordingly. This tapestry was originally hung in a Paris salon surrounded by imported Chinese cabinets, chinoiserie (Chinese-inspired) screens, and crimson upholstery and curtains.

    "text": "Worn by elites for centuries, Kashmiri shawls are fascinating documents of style, craft, and meticulous labor. This shawl was made for the European export market in the mid-19th century when they were at the height of style among fashionable ladies of Europe. Numerous paintings, such as the MIA's \"Portrait of the Gaspard Moeremans Family\" (see photo below 91.35 detail), portray women draped in Kashmiri shawls, displaying their status and wealth. Shawl production was a labor intensive process from start to finish. The finest shawls used soft fleece (termed pashmina or cashmere) collected from the underbelly of a wild Himalayan mountain goat. Their construction involved a complicated chain of command, including government inspectors, merchants, workshop owners, pattern makers, and finally, weavers. Weavers sat on the ground at their looms and followed the instruction of an individual who read aloud from a written pattern code that described each line of weaving, which in this case produced a design dominated by paisley, palmette, and blossoming tree motifs. Like many other shawls from this period, multiple pieces of cloth have been woven separately and stitched together to create the overall design. This shawl was additionally worked with fine embroidery, highlighting the edges and surfaces of woven patterns with brightly colored silk thread. The predominant color of the embroidery is a bright sky blue, which is supplemented by a dazzling array of other colors stitched in mind-boggling detail. The ripples in the fabric are a result of its warping over time, but suggest how the pattern was meant to be seen, resting in curves around its owner's shoulders",

    "text": "This allegorical figure of America from a set of continents is attributed to one of Meissen's most important sculptors, Johann Joachim Kaendler (1706-1775), whose principal contribution lay in the area of porcelain figurines. Here, \"America\" is portrayed as a idealized semi-nude Native American woman, who is depicted in regal garb among some of her attributes, animals and plants native to the American continent. Europeans of the period perceived America as an exotic and fertile land, populated by unusual peoples and animals such as the alligator and the parrot. Indeed, animals were a common motif for Kaendler, who even produced some life-size porcelain specimens. His works are prized for their lively, Baroque expressivity and are based on careful study of nature. They stand at the high point of Meissen design.",

Each curatorial department was represented. The arrival of more than 60 contemporary works of art from Target’s corporate art collection, nearly 4,000 textiles from the Jack Lenor Larsen archive donated by Cowtan & Tout in 1999, 475 objects from the Norwest Modernism Collection donated by Wells Fargo in 1998, and the ongoing gifts of Asian art from Ruth and Bruce Dayton all contributed to this opportunity to view an encyclopedic collection of world art. This collection embodied remarkable depth and breadth, providing a solid launching point and establishing a high level of quality for the museum’s future.",

Its intricate design resulted from a laborious process of hand-drawing, block printing, and vat dyeing that took weeks to complete. Soon after their involvement in Indian Ocean networks, European traders observed a demand for chintz among elite buyers back home, and responded by suggesting designs to Indian manufacturers so that their goods kept step with European textile trends. The pattern on this chintz mimics silk designs popular throughout Western Europe in the early eighteenth century, but the rare presence of an English East India Company trade stamp on the back tells us the panel was destined specifically for English markets.",

It is moulded on each side in high relief with two central Asian musicians flanking a smaller central Asian dancer, the men all wearing belted tunics and baggy pants tucked into high boots. Central Asian musicians and entertainers arrived in China via the Silk Road during the sixth century and a wide interest in central Asian exoticism became an important feature of Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) culture. Several different musical styles including the hu xuan \"nomadic whirl\" are mentioned in the Sui Shu history of the Sui dynasty, and the excellent preservation of this vessel clearly shows the musicians with long curly hair and other foreign features playing the flute and clapping their hands in rhythmic gesture.",

        "description": "In March 2015 it was announced that the Japanese art collection of St. Paul native Mary Griggs Burke, long considered the finest private collection of its kind outside of Japan, is bequeathed to the MIA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The MIA will highlight the breadth of this gift by presenting an exhibition that features more than 170 masterpieces of Japanese and Korean art, ranging from prehistoric to the late 19th century. Among the objects are stunning ink paintings like Kichizan Mincho's (1352–1431) interpretation of the bodhisattva Monju by the artist, a 16th-century water jar (mizusashi) known as \"Burst Bag\" from the kilns in Iga for use in tea ceremony, a pair of folding screens of hollyhocks and plum trees by the artist Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), a pair of screens of Chinese children playing \"crack the whip\" and examining an elephant by the eccentric artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), and a luminous 12th-century celadon Korean maebyong vessel inlaid with a pattern ofa crane amid clouds.
