debug polyline being misplaced on first load -- L.flyTo to blame?
  it doesn't happen when touchpad zooming
optimize polyline - draw between close geographic neighbors 
animate layer transitions - https://github.com/naturalatlas/leaflet-transitionedicon
set maxBounds on map

bug with arts in multiple threads
  `art.coords.reverse` called multiple times results in reversed latlng
  probably they should not be duplicated, but just one marker?
    could it be 'a chameleon'?
      two different colors until one thread is activated
      then it assumes the color of the active thread?

break out pages/routes
  index shows map
  threads/:id - a single thread
  threads/:id/:artworkId - an artwork within a thread                \
                               (these two are a basically dupesâ€¦) <= |
  art/:id - art with a default thread or art indexing all threads?   /
  check on server rendering
    map won't show, so what's the placeholder?
    getInitialProps for each page
