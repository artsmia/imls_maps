Around 1600, Holland and England began to dominate trade with India, Southeast Asia, and China. By the mid-1700s, many other European nations had also established trade connections with that region.

Europeans exchanged silver for spices, tea, and coffee, as well as textiles, porcelain, and gold. 

The vast wealth generated by this trade ushered in a golden era for Holland: it was the wealthiest country in Europe, a place where the arts and sciences flourished.

The China trade sparked long-distance artistic collaboration as Chinese manufacturers began creating porcelain wares and wallpapers that appealed to European and American tastes.
