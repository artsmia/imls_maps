“Chinoiserie” is the European interpretation and imitation of Chinese and other East Asian artistic traditions. 

The chinoiserie craze took off in Europe during the late 1600s with the influx of items from China, India, and Japan.

Many chinoiserie items were mash-ups of Asian styles and forms created by European artists primarily interested in pleasing the tastes of their clients.

At chinoiserie’s peak in the 1700s, many wealthy households in Europe, North America, and South America had furnishings, or even whole rooms and gardens, created by artists in a style they thought to be Chinese.
