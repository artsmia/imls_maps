The religion of Buddhism emerged from the teachings of a prince who lived in northern India some 2,500 years ago.

Buddhists seek escape from suffering by attaining enlightenment, then entering a state of eternal bliss called nirvana.

As Buddhism spread from India to China to elsewhere in Asia it acquired aspects of local beliefs.

The teachings and texts of Buddhism expanded and evolved as the religion spread, such that Buddhism came to encompass a vast array of deities.
