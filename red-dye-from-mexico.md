Aztec and Mayan peoples first discovered cochineal, a red dye made from tiny bugs that live on the prickly pear cactus. 

Across Europe, red was the color of wealth, power, and privilege.  Spanish colonists realized cochineal’s value—it was bright and didn’t fade. 

By the late 1500s, Spanish ships transported tons of cochineal each year to supply the textile centers of northern Europe.

Artists with family connections to the textile trade experimented with cochineal as a paint pigment. They extracted the red by soaking leftover scraps of red cloth.
