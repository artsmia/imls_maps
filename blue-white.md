Simple yet elegant, “blue and white”-- white porcelain painted with a blue glaze--found admirers in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North and South America.

The blue in blue and white pottery is cobalt oxide, first discovered and used in the Middle East.

Mongols invaded the Middle East and brought cobalt oxide to China, where artists applied it to white porcelain. The exquisite results were made for the Chinese Imperial Court.

Potters from the Netherlands to Mexico emulated the color schemes and designs of Chinese blue and white for their local customers.
