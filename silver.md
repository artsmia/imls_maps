Vast amounts of silver flowed from the Americas to China from around 1500 to 1800 and exchanged for Chinese silk, tea, porcelain, and gold.


China switched from paper to silver currency around 1500, creating a huge demand for silver.


Spanish colonists exploited rich silver deposits in Peru and Mexico beginning in 1545 and sent 50 tons of silver to China each year.


Until about 1750, about 85% of the world’s silver supply came from Spanish Peru and Mexico.


Most European and Colonial North American silver sculpture and tableware from around 1550 through the 1700s was made of melted down Mexican silver pesos, which were used as currency around the globe.
