## Asian Design and Influence

### Imagining Faraway Lands

This musician’s fanciful instrument is likely a figment of the artist’s imagination. His clothing is also more fiction than fact. The silk robe trimmed in gold, the gilded waist and neckline, and the flashy European-style shoes resemble nothing that would have been worn by actual Chinese musicians. Even his hat, though based on a style worn by Asian farmers, is more elaborate than the usual type. But this was the point: The image appealed to Europeans who wished to imagine the faraway land of China.
