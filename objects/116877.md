## Buddhism

### Hybrid Deities

In many cultures, Buddhism accommodated local beliefs that existed before its arrival. By the time Buddhism came to Japan, it already included Hindu elements from India and facets of Chinese beliefs such as Daoism and Confucianism. The resulting hybrid deities were further merged with local gods of Shinto, Japan’s native belief system. This sculpture depicts a uniquely Japanese deity called Akiba Gongen. He is a tengu (a beaked, winged supernatural being), but wears the robes of a Buddhist monk and carries the sword and lasso associated with a Buddhist deity known as Fudō Myōō. He rides a mythological flying white fox with a coiled snake on his forehead—the vehicle of Dakini, a Hindu goddess of fertility.
