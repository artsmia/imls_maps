## Red dye from Mexico

### Relish for red

The Dutch city of Amsterdam was a hub of global trade in the 1600s. Worldwide networks provided residents like Lucia Wijbrants—daughter and widow of cloth merchants—with the world’s finest luxuries, and the wealth to commission a painter to record them for posterity.

Trade networks also influenced production of Persian rugs, like the one here. In the mid-1500s, weavers began using red dye produced from beetles found in the Americas. Even with the cost of shipping, the dye was cheaper because American beetles were easier to farm and harvest and produced a more concentrated dye than more local sources.
