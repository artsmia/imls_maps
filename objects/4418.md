The global trade that brought the finest luxuries to this Amsterdam merchant’s home—silver from the Americas, silk and gold from China—may also have influenced the making of Persian rugs like the one seen here.

Until the mid-1500s, Persian weavers used costly cochineal dye from the beetle’s Armenian cousin. American cochineal was far cheaper (though still expensive), even with the cost of shipping.

How could bugs from around the world be cheaper than local ones? The cultivated American beetles were larger, easier to farm and harvest, and produced a more concentrated color requiring less dye.
