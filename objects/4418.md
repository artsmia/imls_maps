The global trade that brought the finest luxuries to this Amsterdam merchant’s home—silver from the Americas, silk and gold from China—may also have influenced the making of Persian rugs like the one seen here.

Until the mid-1500s, Persian weavers used costly cochineal dye from the beetle’s Armenian cousin. American cochineal was far cheaper (though still expensive), even with the cost of shipping.

How could bugs from around the world be cheaper than local ones? The cultivated American beetles were larger, easier to farm and harvest, and produced a more concentrated color requiring less dye.

## Cochineal

Relish for red

The Dutch city of Amsterdam was a hub of global trade in the 1600s. Worldwide networks provided residents like Lucia Wijbrants—daughter and widow of cloth merchants—with the world’s finest luxuries, and the wealth to commission a painter to record them for posterity.

Trade networks also influenced production of Persian rugs, like the one here. In the mid-1500s, weavers began using red dye produced from beetles found in the Americas. Even with the cost of shipping, the dye was cheaper because American beetles were easier to farm and harvest and produced a more concentrated dye than more local sources.
