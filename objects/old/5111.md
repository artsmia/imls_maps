Silkworms excrete silk to make cocoons. The fiber’s triangular, prism-like structure allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles so that it shimmers.

It takes 2,500 silkworms to produce one pound of silk: enough for one robe. Rearing silkworms – sericulture – was an important source of income to Chinese farming families. This type of silkworm cocoon-shaped jar may have been used in the ritual practices of sericulture as the rearing of silkworms was fraught with superstitions.
