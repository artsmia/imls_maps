Miniature painting on paper emerged in Persia in the 1200s and became an international art form virtually overnight. With the Mongol conquests (late 1200s) came Chinese influence. It later inspired the Islamic miniature traditions of Turkey, India, and Pakistan.

This 1551 book of philosophical advice for rulers comes from Bukhara, a major trade center along the Silk Road, in Uzbekistan. Adding to the international flavor, thatâ€™s Alexander the Great on the throne listening to a bearded philosopher.
