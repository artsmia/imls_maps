Venetian painter Jacopo Robusti is known by his nickname, “Tintoretto” or “Little Dyer.” His father was a cloth dyer (tintore) in the city famous for textile production.

Tintoretto matured as a painter in the 1550s, about the time Venetian dyers went crazy for American cochineal. He made liberal use of the new “red lake” pigments produced from cochineal-dyed scraps of silk.

Painters across Europe took note of the “Venetian method” of painting drapery, which exploited the translucency of red lake applied over layers of underpainting to suggest the shimmer of luxurious silk and velvet.
