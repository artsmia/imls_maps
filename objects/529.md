## Red dye from Mexico

### Is that cochineal red?

The only way to know for sure is to test it with chemical analysis, but currently available tests require taking a physical sample from the painting. Weâ€™re not quite ready to part with even a tiny chip of this painting. 

Rembrandt certainly had red pigments made from cochineal in his paint box. Testing has confirmed cochineal glazes in at least three of his works, painted both before and after this one.
