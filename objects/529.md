Is that cochineal red? The only way to know for sure is to test it with chemical analysis.

Currently available tests require taking a physical sample from an inconspicuous spot on a painting. But red is often used in prominent areas, making testing difficult. The process also requires highly specialized skills.

Rembrandt certainly had red lake pigments made from cochineal in his paint box. Testing has confirmed cochineal glazes in at least three works, painted both before and after this one.
