## The China Trade

### This cabinet may have been made in Japan with Japanese motifs, but it was intended solely for the European market. Lacquer furniture made in Japan, like this piece based on a bargue√±o (a type of desk that emerged in Spain in the 1500s), became highly desirable in Holland. So much so that a company was established in Amsterdam in 1610 to import these crafts. The shiny look of lacquer could not be replicated in Europe because the key component was derived from a particular sumac tree found only in Asia.
