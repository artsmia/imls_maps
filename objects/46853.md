## Blue and White Ceramics

### Quintessential Blue-and-White

This vase was not made for a foreign buyer. It was destined for China's imperial court. If anything, Chinese consumers were even more avid collectors of blue and white porcelain than were Europeans, Persians, or South Asians, and in general they demanded higher quality. In that regard, this vase delivers: the crisp and flowing lines and complex design are the work of a master porcelain painter.
