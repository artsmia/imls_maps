## Blue & White Ceramics

### Freedom, energy, sophistication

Vessels like this Xuande period meiping vase illustrate the decorative technique of blue-and-white wares at its most accomplished. It combines freedom and energy of a newly emergent art form with the sophistication of concept and mastery of technique that comes with maturity. It features an exuberant five-claw imperial dragon as the central motif, which projects an air of majesty and power as it strides around the surface of the vessel. Four frontal lion masks, alternating with stylized clouds, decorate the shoulder.
