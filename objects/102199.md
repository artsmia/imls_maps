China annexed Vietnam from 1407 â€“ 1428, and Vietnamese potters learned Chinese blue-and-white techniques. Chinese blue-and-white wares, like this stem bowl, made their way to Vietnam. Ironically, just as China relinquished control of Vietnam it imposed a 30-year ban on its own ceramic trade, giving Vietnamese potters a leg up on the international market.

This pear-shaped bottle is closely related to Chinese prototypes both in shape and decoration. The floral panels painted in underglaze blue are set against a wave background. Cloud whirls adorn the neck, plantain leaves appear below the rim, and lotus leaf lappets encircle the base
