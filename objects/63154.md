## The China Trade

### Tea: an Expensive Commodity

This tea set took a winding path from raw materials to finished object. Commissioned in 1792 by a wealthy colonist in Boston, it was made of silver originally from Mexico or South America— typically in the form of coins, which had been melted down for new purposes. The locked boxes held loose tea likely from China, another product of the growing global economy—so valuable it was kept under lock and key.

## The Silver Trade

### Teapots from Melted Coins

American colonists often kept silver in the form of coins and domestic items in their home. The coins could be melted down to make elaborate tea sets like this one. Due to its versatility and utility, many silver objects no longer remain intact. Because of this, silversmiths strove to create masterworks in order to deter owners from melting down their creations. That may explain why this elaborate tea set remains unscathed.
