## Buddhism

### Universal features, local styles

Artists have used common conventions to depict the Buddha, but have expressed them through local styles. This head belongs stylistically to the latter part of the reign of King Jayavarman VII (1181–1219), a devout Buddhist who established the Bayon as his state temple in the Khmer capital of Angkor and commissioned numerous Buddhist sculptures to fill that space and others. The elongated ear lobes indicate the Buddha’s enlightened status, while the prominent pyramidal shape atop his head represents his wisdom. This work is a prime example of a new style based on a more naturalistic body and face: a faint smile, closed eyes, hair rendered like a tight-fitting cap with a lotus-shaped bun.
