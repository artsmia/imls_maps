## The Silver Trade

### Spaniards in Peru

By 1530, Spain had conquered much of Central and South America through a brutal takeover of indigenous societies including the Aztecs, Mayans, and the Incas. This kero, or vessel, was used to serve a beer made out of fermented corn during Incan religious ceremonies and social celebrations. The top scene features an interaction between Inca chiefs and two men who wear Spanish costume highlighting the significance of the Spanish invasion for the indigenous tribe.
