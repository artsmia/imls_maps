The shape of this vase imitates Chinese models of the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) with attached ring handles, but its flaring neck shows the Egyptian potter's greater familiarity with local glass mosque lamps. The decoration imitates Ming porcelains of the Hsuan-te reign (1426-35), but the inability of Middle Eastern potters to control vessel shapes and underglaze designs as well as the Chinese is apparent in this early example of blue-and-white. This rare vase was, however, considered worthy enough to be signed by its maker, Men'l'Ezz.
