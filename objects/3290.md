## Blue & White Ceramics

### Signed, Sealed, Delivered

The shape of this Egyptian vase imitates Chinese models with attached ring handles, but its flaring neck shows the potter's greater familiarity with local glass mosque lamps. The decoration imitates Chinese Ming porcelains but the inability of Middle Eastern potters to control vessel shapes and underglaze designs as well as the Chinese is apparent in this early example of blue-and-white. This vase was, however, considered worthy enough to be signed by its maker, Men'l'Ezz.
