## Blue & White Ceramics

### Signed, Sealed, Delivered

This early Egyptian attempt to mimic Chinese blue-and-white pottery was considered worthy enough to be signed by its maker, Men'l'Ezz. However, it would not have met Chinese standards: the blue pattern runs into the white base and the vessel lost its shape during firing. The shape resembles certain Chinese pottery with attached ring handles, and the decoration suggests Chinese Ming porcelains, but the flaring neck shows the potterâ€™s greater familiarity with local glass mosque lamps.
