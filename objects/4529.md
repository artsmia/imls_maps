Red dye from Mexican cochineal farms reached cloth producers around the world by the 1600s. But it didn’t come to their neighbors to the north, the Navajo of the American Southwest, until the late 1700s.

Even then, Navajo weavers did not have access to the dye itself. Instead, they worked with yarns and cloth manufactured in Europe or the Near East. The imported cloth was unraveled into yarn or cut into strips and rewoven.

Documents record Spanish government orders for cochineal-dyed cloth to reward certain Navajo Indians “for good conduct.”
