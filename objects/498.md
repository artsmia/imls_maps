The blue in blue-and-white pottery is cobalt-blue oxide, a Middle Eastern invention. And it is in the Middle East that this iconic design scheme got its start. This bowl was made in Iraq sometime between 800-900. During the period of Mongol rule in the 1300s, technically superior Chinese blue-and-white ware began to be exported to the Middle East, where it gained immediate popularity among the Muslim upper classes and influenced Middle Eastern styles for centuries to come.
