The Catholic church was a major force behind the voracious European demand for red fueling the cochineal trade.

For centuries, popes and kings favored deep purple robes colored with dye made from Mediterranean sea snails. But the fall of Constantinople in 1453 disrupted that supply.

In 1464 Pope Pius II introduced “cardinal’s purple,” actually a red produced from the tiny kermes beetle. Cochineal from Mexico, far cheaper than kermes when it appeared in the 1520s, rapidly took its place in the production of church robes, cushions, curtains, and other cloths.
