## Red dye from Mexico

### A robe fit for a king- or Pope

The Catholic Church was a major force behind the huge European demand for red. For centuries, popes and kings favored deep purple robes colored with dye made from Mediterranean sea snails. But the fall of Constantinople in 1453 disrupted that supply to Rome. In 1464 Pope Pius II introduced “cardinal’s purple,” actually a red produced from the tiny kermes beetle. Cochineal from Mexico rapidly took its place in the production of church robes, like the one worn here by a cardinal, and also in other decorative items like cushions, curtains, and other cloths.
