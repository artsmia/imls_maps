The Chinese empireâ€™s expansion across most of central Asia owed much to the two-humped Bactrian camel. (They are named for Bactria, an historical region that included modern-day Afghanistan.) Camels were treasured for reliably transporting people and trade goods through the great Gobi and Taklamakan deserts. Most camel herders were foreigners from Mongolia, Tibet, and central Asia.
