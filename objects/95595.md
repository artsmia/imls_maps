## The Silk Road

### Cross-continental trade: unable to break the camel's’ back

The two-humped Bactrian camel is named for Bactria, a historical region that included modern-day Afghanistan, and were herded mostly by foreigners from Mongolia, Tibet, and central Asia. Dubbed the “ships of the desert,” the camels reliably ferried people and trade goods through the great deserts that cover the interior of Asia.
