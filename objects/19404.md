## The China Trade

### Capitalizing on Growing Markets

Elaborate wallpapers like this one were hand-painted in China to decorate homes in Europe and New England. They were status symbols, signaling the refined and expensive tastes of homeowners to their guests. They were also examples of Chinese producers cashing in on the growing hunger in Europe and the United States for all things Chinese by creating goods specifically for these foreign markets.

## Asian Design and Influence

### Poor Taste?

This hand-painted wallpaper was produced in China in the mid-1800s for consumers in Europe and the USA. Chinese painted wallpaper had remained popular among Europeans and the Americans throughout the 1700s and 1800s. Even as hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrated to California in the 1840s and 50s, on the Atlantic coast China remained a distant abstraction known largely through exports like this.

## The Silver Trade

### Goods Created for a Foreign Market

There was great demand for products from China and Japan in Europe like this wallpaper made in China for a European home. However, there was little market for European goods in Asia. This resulted in a trade imbalance that prompted Europeans, especially the British, to seek other goods besides silver and gold to use for trade. A global shortage of silver also prompted the move. That alternative import was opium grown in India. This new export and heightened demand in China for opium lessened the trade disparity and allowed the British to continue to import goods like this wallpaper into Britain.
