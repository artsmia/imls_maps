## The China Trade

### Elaborate wallpapers like this one were hand-painted in China to decorate homes in Europe and New England. They were status symbols, signaling the refined and expensive tastes of homeowners to their guests. They were also examples of Chinese producers cashing in on the growing hunger in Europe and the United States for all things Chinese by creating goods specifically for these foreign markets.

## Asian Design in Europe

### This hand-painted wallpaper was produced in China in the late 1700s or early 1800s for the Western market—a phenomenon known as chinoiserie. Despite its popularity, the style was deemed unsophisticated by some elites. They thought it was only suitable for women, whose interests they judged to be equally unsophisticated. This notion that Asian art—and other art inspired by it—was not intellectually stimulating stemmed from both a lack of understanding and a muddling of tradition, something lost in translation when East met West.
