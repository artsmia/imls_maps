## Buddhism

### Hellbound

Followers of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism believed strongly in Hell, and that the frightening figures presiding over it could be pacified through prayer. Introduced to Korea in the 600s, Pure Land teachings had fallen out of favor long before a revival in the 1800s, when this sculpture was created. Korean monks installed statues or paintings depicting the fierce Kings of Hell in the temple halls where they lived and studied, and prayed to the images in hopes of easing the punishments meted out on the souls of the deceased. An attendant figure like this one would have stood alongside the Kings of Hell: he holds a long scroll on which he would record the names and judgments handed down by a King.
