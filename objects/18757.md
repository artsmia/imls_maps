## The Silver Trade

### Sugar Bowl Today, Currency Tomorrow?

Silver was not only used as a form of currency, but was also used in decorative yet useful objects like this silver sugar bowl. Items like this one would have been used for the tradition of taking afternoon tea, which was typical for wealthy European colonizers in the Americas. It likely would have been displayed prominently with other silver items in the home to demonstrate their refined taste and wealth. However, should a family fall on hard times silver could be melted down and used as currency.
