The pottery made in Iran from the second half of the 1200s, although following earlier traditions, is distinctive in its robust shapes and use of black and blue. Chinese patterns, such as lotuses, dragons, and phoenixes, were copied from luxury goods traded to the Middle East and introduced in the decorative repertoire of all arts, including tiles and ceramic vessels.
