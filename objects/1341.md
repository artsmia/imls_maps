## Red dye from Mexico

### Like father, like son?

Flemish painter Anthony Van Dyck was the son of a silk merchant in Antwerp who made a fortune importing luxury fabrics from China. Son Anthony was known for painting richly colored silks and velvets that shimmer and shine. The red cloak carried by Jesus Christ (shown on the right hand side of the painting) was painted using a color named “red lake,” originally produced from scraps of silk dyed with cochineal. The richly colored glaze was essential for suggesting the flowing draperies that add so much to the scene.
