Not more than twenty years old when he painted this picture, Anthony Van Dyck was “the best of my pupils,” according to Peter Paul Rubens, master painter of Northern Europe.

Van Dyck shared Rubens’ admiration for Titian and Tintoretto. Through the Venetians, he inherited a palette that included red lake, essential for rendering the flowing draperies that add so much to the emotion of the scene.

Van Dyck exploits the symbolism of the color, too. Christ, always the humble servant, slings the red robe associated with royalty over his arm at the moment of his betrayal.

## Cochineal

Like father, like son?

Flemish painter Anthony Van Dyck was the son of a silk merchant in Antwerp who made a fortune importing the luxury fabrics from China. Son Anthony was known for painting richly colored silks and velvets that shimmer and shine.

Van Dyck depended upon painting techniques pioneered by Venetian painters like Titian and Tintoretto. Their palette included the color “red lake,” originally produced from scraps of silk dyed with cochineal. The richly colored glaze was essential for suggesting the flowing draperies that add so much to the scene.
