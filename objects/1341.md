## Red dye from Mexico

### Like father, like son?

Flemish painter Anthony Van Dyck was the son of a silk merchant in Antwerp who made a fortune importing the luxury fabrics from China. Son Anthony was known for painting richly colored silks and velvets that shimmer and shine.

Van Dyck depended upon painting techniques pioneered by Venetian painters like Titian and Tintoretto. Their palette included the color “red lake,” originally produced from scraps of silk dyed with cochineal. The richly colored glaze was essential for suggesting the flowing draperies that add so much to the scene.
