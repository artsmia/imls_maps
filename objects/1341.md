Not more than twenty years old when he painted this picture, Anthony Van Dyck was “the best of my pupils,” according to Peter Paul Rubens, master painter of Northern Europe.

Van Dyck shared Rubens’ admiration for Titian and Tintoretto. Through the Venetians, he inherited a palette that included red lake, essential for rendering the flowing draperies that add so much to the emotion of the scene.

Van Dyck exploits the symbolism of the color, too. Christ, always the humble servant, slings the red robe associated with royalty over his arm at the moment of his betrayal.
