## Buddhism

### An Indian Tradition in China

This head of a buddha once belonged to a large sculpture that was probably located on the wall of a cave temple. Often the back wall of a cave was devoted to a large buddha, like this one, flanked by attendant bodhisattvas. Cave-temple architecture was inspired by Indian and Central Asian traditions. While a popular form or religious architecture in China, only a few cave-temple sites exist further east in Asia, in Korea and Japan. There, wooden architecture was favored.
