### A Buddhist Pilgrim

This colorful scroll shows the historical Buddha surrounded by famous Buddhist teachers. Second from the right on the bottom row is the Chinese monk Xuanzang (c. 602–664), shown with a tiger. Concerned that the Buddhist texts reaching China were incomplete and misinterpreted, Xuanzang set out on a lengthy pilgrimage to study Buddhism in Central Asia and India, Buddhism’s birthplace. He returned to China with hundreds of texts that became the core of Buddhist scripture in China, Korea, and Japan. The tiger in some Tibetan and Chinese paintings of Xuanzang represents animal ferocity pacified by the Buddha’s aura. In Japan, where pilgrimages were particularly celebrated, Xuanzang was often portrayed as a traveling monk.
