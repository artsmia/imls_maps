## Red dye from Mexico

### The "Little Dyer"

Venetian painter Jacopo Robusti is known by his nickname, “Tintoretto” or “Little Dyer.” His father was a cloth dyer (tintore) in Venice, a city famous for textile production. Painters and dyers alike benefited from the new, cheaper pigments from south America for dying fabrics. Although textile guilds resisted innovation, they gradually came to accept these new materials. Painters like Tintoretto made liberal use of the new “red lake” pigments produced from cochineal-dyed scraps of silk.
