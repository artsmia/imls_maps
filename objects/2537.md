## Buddhism

### Belief born from catastrophe

From about 1000 to 1200, Japan’s capital of Kyoto was wracked by disease, natural disasters, and fires. The people who lived there became convinced they had entered a long period of decline in which the Buddha’s teaching would degenerate—to the point that personal attempts at salvation were useless. This belief fueled the rise of Pure Land teachings, which offered an easier path to salvation. Instead of relying on one’s own efforts, requiring extensive study and complex rituals, a believer could tap the so-called “other power” of Amitabha. Repeatedly calling out Amitabha’s name, or contemplating a sculpture or painting of the deity, would result in Amitabha descending from the heavens at the moment of a believer’s death and transporting him or her to an eternal paradise known as the Pure Land.
