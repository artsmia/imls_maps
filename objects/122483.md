## The China Trade

### New Designs in Home Decor

This cabinet may have been made in Japan with Japanese motifs, but it was intended solely for the European market. Lacquer furniture made in Japan, like this piece based on a bargue√±o (a type of desk that emerged in Spain in the 1500s), became highly desirable in Holland. So much so that a company was established in Amsterdam in 1610 to import these crafts. The shiny look of lacquer could not be replicated in Europe because the key component was derived from a particular sumac tree found only in Asia.
