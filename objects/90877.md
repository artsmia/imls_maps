During the Yuan period (1280-1368), Chinese blue-and-white wares were greatly admired in Persia, the chief market for large serving dishes like this. This work, however, represents the moment in the late 1300s when blue-and-white began to catch on back home in China. The influence of Persian d√©cor such as the floral and ivy-like scrolling motifs found in Middle Eastern metal work can be seen in the central and middle registers.
