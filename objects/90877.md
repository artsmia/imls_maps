## Blue & White Ceramics

### Developing Styles

During the Yuan period (1280–1368), the major market for China’s signature blue-and-white wares was Persia (present-day Iran). But by the 1300s they were beginning to catch on back home.

In fact, the floral and ivy-like scrolling motifs in the center and middle ring were directly copied from Middle Eastern metalwork.
