## The China Trade

### A Lucrative Line of Work

1628 was evidently a great time to be a jeweler in Holland. This portrait of goldsmith Lucas van Voorst, as well as a matching portrait of his wife Caterina, presents the couple as prosperous and fashionable citizens. The Dutch trade with Asia created vast wealth in Holland, ensuring that tradespeople like Lucas had many customersâ€”as well as a ready supply of the metals, pearls, and gemstones he needed to create his luxurious baubles.

## The Silver Trade

### Jeweler Benefits from Silver Trade

Lucas van Voorst was a goldsmith and jeweler in the Dutch town of Utrecht who would have benefited from the global trade economy. Dutch trade with Asia surged in the 1600s with the founding of the Dutch East India Company, which exchanged gold and silver for luxury goods. 

Significant amounts of silver was passing through the Netherlands on its way to China in exchange for gold. Good news for goldsmiths like van Voorst.
