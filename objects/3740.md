## The China Trade

### Exotic Imports as Status Symbols

Lucas van Voorst (1590–1669) was a goldsmith and jeweler in the Dutch town of Utrecht. Yet Paul Moreelse, one of the finest portrait painters of the time, offers no indication that van Voorst is a craftsman. Instead, he shows the man as a prosperous citizen, fashionably dressed, his table covered with an exotic and presumably expensive Persian rug. A family chronicle describes Lucas as “an amiable man, not vindictive, affectionate and beloved by his friends, charitable, generous, gay…. He was of medium height, with well-made shoulders, legs, and calves, or a merry countenance, with some red and white intermixed.”

## The Silver Trade

### Jeweler Benefits from Silver Trade

Lucas van Voorst was a goldsmith and jeweler in the Dutch town of Utrecht who would have benefited from the global trade economy. Dutch trade with Asia surged in the 1600s with the founding of the Dutch East India Company, which exchanged gold and silver for luxury goods. 

Significant amounts of silver was passing through the Netherlands on its way to China in exchange for gold. Good news for goldsmiths like van Voorst.
