## Asian Design and Influence

### 

Chinoiserie in New England

Made in New England in the early 1800s, this table is covered in Chinese- and Japanese-inspired motifs. The inspiration for these designs likely came from pattern books made by Europeans to guide new “Japaners” (the name given to non-Asian craftspeople specializing in chinoiserie). The books also provided directions for imitating the techniques of Asian artisans, such as lacquer work and pattern design.
