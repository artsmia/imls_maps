## Buddhism

### Different Route, Different Look

This statue from Thailand differs in some key ways from Buddhist sculptures made in China, Korea, and Japan. That’s because Buddhism reached Thailand from a different source: from east and south India through Sri Lanka, instead of overland through Central Asia. Standing images of the Buddha, which had been made in Sri Lanka since the 400s, present a distinctly human view of the prince who attained enlightenment then devoted the rest of his life to showing other people how to escape their suffering. Here, he is a teacher of the people, walking peacefully with his eyes lowered. Sri Lankan influence can also be seen in the flame-like projection atop the Buddha’s head—something the artist would have noted on Sri Lankan sculptures brought to Thailand. Elsewhere in Asia, this feature looks more like a crown or a hair bun.
