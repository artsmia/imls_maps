## Red dye from Mexico

### The "Little Dyer"

Venetian painter Jacopo Robusti is known by his nickname, “Tintoretto” or “Little Dyer.” His father was a cloth dyer (tintore) in a city famous for textile production.

Venice had been a textile giant ever since Marco Polo’s expedition linked the city with sources of raw silk along the Silk Road. Strict quality control regulations kept the brand in high demand.

Textile guilds resisted innovation, but gradually came to accept the use of new, cheaper pigments from South America for dying fabrics. Painters like Tintoretto made liberal use of the new “red lake” pigments produced from cochineal-dyed scraps of silk.
