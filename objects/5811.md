## Asian Design and Influence

### Influential Chairs

The curving central panels, or back splats, of these chairs served as models for furniture makers in England and their colleagues in the British colonies in North America. The replication of this feature, which in the colonies was introduced around 1720, was due as much to an awareness of Chinese aesthetics as it was to an interest in physical comfort. Beginning as an explicit reference to Chinese design, this element was quickly absorbed into Euro-American decorative arts and lost its Asian associations.
