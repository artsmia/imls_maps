## Asian Design and Influence

### Japanese-style French Furniture

European craftsmen like Claude Charles Saunier, who designed this cabinet, were inspired by the Asian imports flooding into Europe in the 1600s and 1700s. They copied the styles and techniques featured in expensive foreign goods. For instance, Saunier modeled this cabinet after a relatively common European furniture type of the time, but the elaborately painted design and lacquer work were inspired by Japanese examples.
