Gandhara, in present-day Pakistan, boasts a central location along the caravan routes connecting China to the West. Over time Greek, Indian, and Persian forces occupied the region and a notably hybrid culture emerged. Gandharan sculptors embraced Greek aesthetics, emphasizing balance, idealized naturalism, and drapery. Their subject matter was not Greek, though, but Indian. Gandhara was an important first step in Buddhismâ€™s spread from India to China.
