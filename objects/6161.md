## Buddhism

### Buddhism at the crossroads

This sculpture is a cultural collage. Made in Gandhara, a historical region in present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, it expresses religious beliefs from India in a Greco-Roman sculptural style (flowing folds, chiseled facial features). Gandhara was a strategic stopping point along the caravan routes between China and lands farther west, and was successively overrun by Greece, India, Persia, and other Central Asian forces between 300 and 460 BCE. As an important Buddhist hub, it became essential to the eastward spread of Buddhism from India.

One hundred years after this sculpture was created, artists also carved massive cave-temples at Bamiyan in what is now central Afghanistan. The caves featured Buddhist sculptures about as tall as a 16-story building—among the world’s most famous Buddhist monuments. In 2001, these ancient treasures were destroyed by the Taliban.
