Gandhara, in present-day Pakistan, boasts a central location along the caravan routes connecting China to the West. Over time Greek, Indian, and Persian forces occupied the region and a notably hybrid culture emerged. Gandharan sculptors embraced Greek aesthetics, emphasizing balance, idealized naturalism, and drapery. Their subject matter was not Greek, though, but Indian. Gandhara was an important first step in Buddhism’s spread from India to China.

## Silk Road

Lucky Charms

Gandhara, in present-day Pakistan, sat on caravan routes connecting China to the West. Over time Greek, Indian, and Persian forces occupied the region. A notably hybrid culture emerged. This sculpture of the Buddha shows Gandharan sculptors’ embrace of Greek aesthetics: counterpoise (the body’s weight rests on one leg, with the other leg slightly bent), idealized naturalism, and flowing drapery. But the subject matter was Indian, not Greek. Gandhara was the first step in Buddhism’s spread from India to China.
