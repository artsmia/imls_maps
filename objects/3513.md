## Blue & White Ceramics

### Shared Vocabulary

This example of Persian-made blue-and-white from the Safavid period (1502-1722) is closely related to Chinese porcelains of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The leaf-patterned rim, tendril design of the inner ring, animal motif in the center, and continuous scroll bands all vaguely refer to Chinese designs.
