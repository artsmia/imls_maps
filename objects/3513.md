When commercial ties to China were reestablished during the 1300s, fine blue-and-white ceramics imported from the Far East became extremely popular and greatly affected subsequent Islamic styles. This outstanding example from the Safavid period (1502-1722) is closely related to Chinese porcelains of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The foliate rim, tendril design of the cavetto, animal motif in the center, and continuous scroll bands all vaguely refer to Chinese designs.
