## Blue & White Ceramics

### Shared Vocabulary

This example of Persian-made blue-and-white from the Safavid period (1502–1722) is closely related to Chinese porcelain of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The leaf-patterned rim, tendril design of the inner ring, animal motif in the center, and continuous scroll bands all vaguely refer to Chinese designs. They wanted to emulate Chinese porcelain, but did not know how to produce fine porcelain. Instead, they focused on surface effects including glaze and pattern.
