## Red dye from Mexico

### Fading Fast

Cochineal red dye used in textiles was valued because it did not fade. Sadly, the cochineal pigment in paintings fades more quickly than other reds. 

But Joshua Reynolds could not resist using it for flesh tones, especially for women and children. 

Urged to use the more stable vermilion (made from the mineral cinnabar) in place of cochineal, Reynolds famously looked at his hand and retorted, “I can see no vermilion in flesh.”
