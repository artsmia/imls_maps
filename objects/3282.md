Besides its spectacular color, cochineal red was prized in textiles because it did not fade. Not so with cochineal pigment in paintings—it is in fact more “fugitive” than other reds.

But Joshua Reynolds could not resist using it for flesh tones, especially for women and children. He render the less delicate skin of men with mineral pigments.

Urged to use the more stable vermilion (made from the mineral cinnabar) in place of cochineal, Reynolds famously looked at his hand and retorted, “I can see no vermilion in flesh.”
