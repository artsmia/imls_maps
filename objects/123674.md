### Art and Karmic Rewards

Wealthy Buddhists commissioned religious art and architecture to reap karmic rewards. This head came from a statue from one of the more than two thousand caves that make up the cave-temple complex of Longmen. Each temple was constructed between 493 and 1127, funded by a wealthy believer. Longmen is just outside the city of Luoyang, which was the capital of China and an important center of Buddhist teaching at a time when prosperity was widespread and Buddhism was flourishing. Chinaâ€™s cave-temple architecture was inspired by Indian and Central Asian traditions. Only a few cave-temple sites exist farther east in Asia, in Korea and Japan, where wooden architecture was favored.
