## Blue & White Ceramics

### Experimental Design

When the Ottoman Turkish sultans began amassing Chinese ceramics and imported wares, Turkish artisans took notice. The rim of this plate is decorated with a stylized waveâ€”a pattern derived from Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. But the potters who made this plate in the Turkish city of Iznik also experimented with a more local decorative vocabulary of tulips, pinks, irises, and cypress not found in this combination on Chinese wares.
