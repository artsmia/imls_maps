## Red Dye from Mexico

### A Complex Path

The red dye that colored the wool in this Navajo-made poncho serape is likely from cochineal insects that were collected in central or south America. Those insects were then shipped to Europe, where they were made into dye that was used to color yarn. That yarn was woven into red flannel cloth which was then traded by European colonists with Navajo people. The Navajo weaver cut and raveled the fabric and then re-wove the yarn into this textile.
