## Buddhism

### An Indian style in Tibet

This sculpture of Amoghasiddhi, one of the “Five Wisdom Buddhas,” is from western Tibet. But stylistically it can be linked to the Pala Empire, which flourished in eastern India and present-day Bangladesh in the 700s to 1100s. This region was a stronghold of Buddhism at a time when the religion was losing devotees elsewhere in India—even as it was spreading rapidly through China and the rest of Asia. Worshippers flocked to the area’s monasteries and scholastic centers, returning home with small sculptures, manuscripts, and drawings that flavored the Buddhist art of Myanmar, Nepal, Tibet, and Indonesia with a Pala artistic style.
