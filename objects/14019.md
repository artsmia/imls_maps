## The China Trade

### Prosperous Merchants in New England

The China trade extended to the British colonies in North America by way of merchants like brothers Joseph and William Russell. They imported goods via Europe, such as spices from Asia and textiles from India. Selling these imports to wealthy New Englanders made the brothers rich enough to build the first three-story house in the town of Providence, Rhode Island, including this parlor.
