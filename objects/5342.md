## Asian Design and Influence

### Imitating Japanese Techniques

This finely carved chair underwent a makeover in order to appeal to the American owner’s taste for things Chinese. The rounded edges of the chair’s back were meant to evoke similar elements characteristic of Chinese chairs. Then, about one hundred years later, the original wood finish was painted to resemble expensive imports from Japan. Japanese lacquer was highly prized and difficult to replicate due to the materials necessary for the process, namely the sap from a sumac tree not found in North America at the time. So-called “Japaners” managed to achieve a similar effect using layers of local materials like black paint, varnish, and shellac.
