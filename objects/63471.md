## Asian Design and Influence

### Exotic Floral Style

This bed curtain is a marriage of New England craftsmanship, British technique, and Asian design. The women who made it used crewelwork, an embroidery technique using fine wool thread that was popular in England at that time. But the colorful and frilly tulips and irises, not to mention the phoenix, peacock, and parrot, were sourced from the textiles from China and India that could be found in New England port towns like Boston and Salem.
