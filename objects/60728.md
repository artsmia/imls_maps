The famous horses that came to China during the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 CE) were imported from the Ferghana Valley, in Central Asia, along the Silk Road. These “heavenly horses” were coveted by the Han military and aristocracy for their strength, size, and endurance, and immortalized in artworks such as this magnificent statue of a young stallion.
