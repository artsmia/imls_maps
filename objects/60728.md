## The Silk Road

### Bronze Beauty

This magnificent statue of a young stallion represents one of the fabled "heavenly horses" of the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 CE). Imported along the Silk Road from Ferghana in Central Asia, western horses were greatly admired for their strength, size, and endurance by the Han military and aristocracy.
