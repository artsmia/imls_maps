## The Silver Trade

### Comforts of Home

The Spanish arrived in Mexico (or New Spain as it was originally named) in 1519. They quickly discovered that much of Mexico and South America was rich in silver, which was shipped to Asia to trade for luxury goods. Newly settled far from home, Spaniards looked to local sources to replicate some of the aspects of European living, including the decoration of their homes. The design of the box is European in form and design, but relies upon the regional techniques of the indigenous craftsmen that produced it. Featuring figures in European dress hunting and playing music, this mash up of styles illustrates the cultural exchange at play during this time.
