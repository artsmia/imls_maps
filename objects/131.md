## Buddhism

### Buddhism in and out of favor

This figure of a bodhisattva—a being who has postponed its own passage to nirvana in order to guide others to salvation—stands on a second-hand base. Inscriptions on the base explain that it originally accompanied a sculpture created in 570 of the historical Buddha, known as Shakyamuni. But by 581 it was supporting another sculpture—this one—at the same Chinese temple. What happened? In 574, Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou dynasty banned Buddhism in favor of Confucianism (the ancient philosophy underpinning Chinese culture), which led to the desecration of many idols—probably including the Shakyamuni statue that once stood on this base. When a new emperor lifted the ban in 581, artists creating this sculpture to replace the original.
