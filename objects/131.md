The eastern edge of the Taklamakan Desert is the starting point of Chinese Buddhist art. Silk Road travelers, thankful to have survived the desert crossing, created art dedicated to the Buddha. This sculpture depicts Guanyin, a Buddhist deity loved for his compassion. Due to his Indian origins, Guanyin was pictured as a Gandharan prince from modern-day Pakistan dressed in silk robes, scarves, and jewelry.
