Founded in 1609, the Dutch East India Company imported into Europe large quantities of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Such thin, translucent porcelain was unknown in Europe at this time and was prized for its beauty and rarity.

Just like the 1300s, when Middle Eastern merchants had assisted Chinese potters in creating wares that appealed to foreign tastes, Dutch traders in the 1600s provided European prints and other source materials. This plate is based on “Symphony of tympanum, lute, and flute,“ a French print. The musicians wear Western costume, but are surrounded by idyllic scenes of rural China.
