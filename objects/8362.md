### Artistic Imaginations

This vase features a scene that is likely based on an elaborate tapestry designed by François Boucher, a famous artist of the mid-1700s, of an imagined Chinese market. Motifs like this tapped into the European fascination with Asian life and culture by exploring fanciful ideas of what nature and leisure were like in Asia. Figures in Chinese dress engage in dance and relaxation among various architectural elements that nod to those present throughout Asia.
