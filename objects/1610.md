Saint Sirus is draped in a silk velvet and gold thread cape. Silk production began in China, but by 1400 Italy and Spain were major centers of silk velvet production. They sold their wares to customers in Europe and Turkey. So expensive were these velvets that only the truly wealthy – or high-ranking church figures – could wear them.
