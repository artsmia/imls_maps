## The Silk Road

### Best Dressed

Saint Sirus is draped in a silk velvet and gold thread cape like those worn by high-ranking church officials in the 1400s. Though silk production had spread from China to Italy and Spain by 1400, the silk velvet from these European countries was still very expensive. Only the truly wealthy or powerful in Europe or Turkey could wear these fine fabrics.
