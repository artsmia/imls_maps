Founded in 1609, the Dutch East India Company imported into Europe large quantities of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Such thin, translucent porcelain was unknown in Europe at this time and was prized for its beauty and rarity.

Envious of this flourishing trade, Dutch potters soon began producing imitations of Chinese porcelain by painting pottery with similar motifs. The city of Delft in the Netherlands became an important center for this type of glazed earthenware.
