## Blue & White Ceramics

### Imitation: the highest form of flattery

When Chinese porcelain began to flow into the Netherlands, Dutch potters faced losses as people sought out this new import. Then they found a way to cash in, producing cheaper imitations painted with similar motifs. The Dutch city of Delft, in particular, became a center for this type of glazed earthenware.

## The China Trade

### The Next Best Thing?

As Chinese ceramics flowed into the Netherlands, Dutch artisans sought to ride the wave with cheaper imitations. And it worked. At the height of production, 32 factories in the Dutch city of Delft were churning out Delftware, a popular style of blue-and-white ceramics painted to resemble the more expensive Chinese imports.
