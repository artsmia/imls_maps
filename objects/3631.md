This magnificent plate was produced in the great ceramic town of Jingdezhen in southern China specifically for the Middle Eastern market. Middle Eastern merchants living in China, who understood the ceramic needs and decorative taste of the Islamic countries, most likely commissioned works like this. This plate’s large size was probably meant to appeal to Islamic customs of serving food from large plates – a practice not found in China. Likewise, the plate’s dense leaf and floral patterns were aimed specifically at Middle Eastern tastes, which the Chinese considered somewhat vulgar during the 1300s.
