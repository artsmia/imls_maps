## The Silk Road

### Global Commerce

Middle Eastern merchants living in China understood the ceramic needs and decorative tastes of Islamic countries along the Silk Road, and they commissioned Chinese artisans to make blue-and-white glazed porcelain especially for that market. The size of this plate, for instance, conformed to Islamic customs of serving food from large, communal platters—a practice not found in China at that time. The dense leaf and floral patterns, popular in the Middle East, were considered somewhat tacky by the Chinese during the 1300s.
