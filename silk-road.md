The Silk Road was a network of trade routes connecting Europe, China, and South Asia.


Silk was prized for its strength, shimmering quality, and its colorfastness. But it was so hard to make that only the wealthiest could afford it.


Silk is the product of an insect: the silkworm secretes silk to make a cocoon.


Silk threads have a triangular cross section and reflect light in multiple directions--like a diamond ring. This is why silk cloth shimmers and sparkles.


It takes 2,500 silk worm cocoons to create 1 pound of silk.


Silkworms were domesticated and farmed about 5,000 years ago in China. It took another 4000 years to reach Europe.
