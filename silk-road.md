The Silk Road was a network of trade routes connecting Europe, China, and South Asia.

Silk was prized for its strength, shimmer, and colorfastness. But it was so hard to make that only the wealthiest could afford it. 

Silk is the product of an insect: the silkworm secretes silk to make a cocoon.

Silk threads have a triangular cross section and reflect light in multiple directionsâ€”like a diamond ring. This is why silk cloth shimmers and sparkles.

It takes 2,500 silkworm cocoons to create one pound of silk.

Silkworms were domesticated and farmed about 5,000 years ago in China.

It took another 4,000 years for silk production to reach Europe.
